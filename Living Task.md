#CS 352 - Evolutionary Computation
#Project: Nodule categorization using Radiomics
#Date: 10/24/2018

##Class Targets:
 - Have key parts of your implementation coded and tested (e.g., fitness function, etc.).
 - Have the research for the literature review well under way. 
 - (Note that different team members can focus on writing/testing different functions, working on 
 - the lit review, etc.)
	
##Project Goals:
 - ROC to describe fitness of various function using genetic programing.
 - SVM, Random forest, and/or Lasso for feature selection.

##Additional Target (If time permits):
 - Compare Eureqa and DEAP approach
